# Data-Trends-and-Anomaly-Detection


**Anomaly detection**, sometimes called **outlier detection**, is a process of finding patterns or instances in a dataset that deviate significantly from the expected or “normal behavior.” Anomalies can occur in various contexts, such as financial transactions, network traffic, or patient vital signs monitoring. Let's explore how to implement anomaly detection in your data:

1. **Understand Anomalies**:
   - Anomalies are events that deviate from the standard and occur rarely.
   - Examples include:
     - **Financial transactions**:
       - Normal: Routine purchases and consistent spending.
       - Outlier: A massive withdrawal hinting at potential fraud.
     - **Network traffic in cybersecurity**:
       - Normal: Regular communication and steady data transfer.
       - Outlier: Abrupt increase in data transfer signaling a breach.
     - **Patient vital signs monitoring**:
       - Normal: Stable heart rate and consistent blood pressure.
       - Outlier: Sudden changes indicating an emergency.

2. **Types of Anomalies**:
   - Anomalies can be:
     - **Point anomalies**: Individual data points that are anomalous.
     - **Contextual anomalies**: Anomalies relative to context (e.g., time, location).
     - **Collective anomalies**: Groups of related data points that are anomalous.

3. **Anomaly Detection Methods**:
   - Use unsupervised methods to identify divergent samples:
     - **Statistical techniques**: Mean, median, quantiles for univariate anomalies.
     - **Machine learning algorithms**:
       - **Isolation Forests**, **One-class SVMs**, **Elliptic Envelopes**, and **Local Outlier Factor**.
       - **Autoencoders** (deep learning) for feature extraction and anomaly detection.

4. **Implementing Anomaly Detection in Python**:
   - Libraries like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **TensorFlow**, and **Scikit-learn** are useful.
   - Consider using **autoencoders** for deep learning-based anomaly detection.
